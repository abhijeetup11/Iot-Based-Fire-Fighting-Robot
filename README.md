# IoT Based Fire Fighting Robot 🔥🤖
## 📌 Project Description
This project is an IoT-based fire fighting robot designed to detect fire, smoke, and temperature
and automatically extinguish fire using a water pump. The robot is controlled using Arduino UNO
and ESP8266 with a real-time IoT dashboard.

## 🛠 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- ESP8266 WiFi Module
- Flame Sensor (IR)
- Smoke Sensor (MQ-2)
- Temperature Sensor (DHT11)
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- Servo Motor
- Water Pump
- Relay Module

## ⚙ Working Principle
1. Sensors detect fire, smoke, and temperature.
2. Arduino processes sensor data.
3. ESP8266 sends data to IoT dashboard.
4. Robot moves towards fire.
5. Water pump activates to extinguish fire.

## 📊 IoT Dashboard
- Real-time temperature monitoring
- Smoke level display
- Fire alert notification
- Manual pump control

## 📁 Project Structure
Arduino code, ESP8266 code, circuit diagram, and dashboard images are included.

## 🚀 Applications
- Industrial fire safety
- Warehouses
- Smart buildings
- Educational projects
